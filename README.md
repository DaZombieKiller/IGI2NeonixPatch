## IGI 2: Neonix Patch

The IGI 2: Neonix Patch is a work-in-progress patch designed to address various gameplay issues and errors found in IGI 2: Covert Strike (version 1.3). This patch focuses on enhancing the overall gameplay experience, fixing several long-standing bugs, and improving the gameâ€™s performance and compatibility with modern systems.

### Major Fixes:

- **Weapon Correct FPS Animations:** Restores accurate first-person shooter animations for smoother weapon handling.
- **Mission Restart Camera Fix:** Fixes the broken camera when restarting missions or interacting with map computers.
- **Mouse and Input Fixes:** Fixes input-related issues when moving the mouse or alt-tabbing while pausing the game.
- **Windowed Mode Mouse Cursor Fix:** Restores proper mouse cursor functionality in windowed mode.
- **Borderless Windowed Mode:** Changes windowed style to borderless mode for better performance and proper rendering over the taskbar.

### Minor Fixes:

- **Objectives Camera Fix:** Resolves the camera position breaking after closing the objectives screen.
- **Alt-Key Bug:** Fixes the bug where the Alt key remains held after alt-tabbing, causing unintended toggling of fullscreen when pressing Enter.
- **Pause Menu Camera Shake Fix:** Removes the annoying camera shaking when pausing the game.

### Work in progress:

- **World Interaction FPS Fix:** Ensures correct frame rate when interacting with objects in the world (e.g., dropping weapons, interacting with doors).
- **Improved Character Movement:** Removes the clunky and rigid movement, making character control smoother and more similar to the original IGI 1.
- **Custom FOV Adjustment:** Allows players to customize their field of view (FOV) for better gameplay perspective.
- **Weapon Laser Lag:** Fixes the lagged behavior of the weapon laser.
- **Gun animation Freeze:** Fixes an issue where holding right-click freezes the gun animation.
