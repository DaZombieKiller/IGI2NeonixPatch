### Major Fixes:

- **Weapon Correct FPS Animations:** Restores accurate first-person shooter animations for smoother weapon handling.
- **HD Textures:** High definition and properly color corrected character textures and loading screens.
- **Mission Restart Camera Fix:** Fixes the broken camera when restarting missions or interacting with map computers.
- **Mouse and Input Fixes:** Fixes input-related issues when moving the mouse or alt-tabbing while pausing the game.

### Minor Fixes:

- **Alt-Key Bug:** Fixes the bug where the Alt key remains held after alt-tabbing, causing unintended toggling of fullscreen when pressing Enter.
- **Pause Menu Camera Shake Fix:** Removes the annoying camera shaking when pausing the game.
- **Windowed Mode Mouse Cursor Fix:** Restores proper mouse cursor functionality in windowed mode.
- **Borderless Windowed Mode:** Changes windowed style to borderless mode for better performance and proper rendering over the taskbar

### Work in progress:

- **World Interaction FPS Fix:** Ensures correct frame rate when interacting with objects in the world (e.g., dropping weapons, interacting with doors).
- **Map fixes:** Correct many issues with the original game maps, and also re-calculate all their lightmaps.
- **Improved Character Movement:** Removes the clunky and rigid movement, making character control smoother and more similar to the original IGI 1.
- **Custom FOV Adjustment:** Allows players to customize their field of view (FOV) for better gameplay perspective.
- **Weapon Laser Lag:** Fixes the lagged behavior of the weapon laser.
- **Gun animation Freeze:** Fixes an issue where holding right-click freezes the gun animation.
- **Animations play/shake jitter:** The animations seem to still move and jitter if you pause the game.
